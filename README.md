# DiskVisualizer
My own version of a disk usage visualizer.

It is not much, I just wanted something to visualize my disk-usage without downloading a software I don't know.

HOW TO USE:

Just enter the path to the directory you want to analyze. Hit 'Enter' and the program is doing the rest. 

The name of every directory which size has been calculated will be printed on the console, so you can see the progress (and so that you don't think it has 
crashed. No guarantee for that btw.)

Here is an example of how the result might look like:

(I know the text-representation is awful)


NOTES:

This is the first version of the program. I just needed a basic visualizer for my disk-usage, so the motto was 'quick and dirty'. That's the reason why
the text-representation looks awful and the actual size of the directorys is not 100% accurate. I try to improve it in the future (e.g. better text, more
accurate sizes etc.)
